they only check the element exist or not so we used linear search
If array was sorted, we’d use Binary Search (O(log N)).

If multiple queries of X were asked, we’d use HashSet for O(1) lookup.
Iteration Example

Let’s run with input:

5 10
7 3 5 2 1


N = 5, X = 10

A = [7, 3, 5, 2, 1]

Python checks step by step:

7 == 10 → False

3 == 10 → False

5 == 10 → False

2 == 10 → False

1 == 10 → False

Since no match found → "NO"
