input
a = [11, 7, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7, 3]
b = [11, 3, 7, 1, 7]

output
true

logic
We need to check whether every element of array b exists in array a, including how many times it appears.
So, we count how many times each value occurs in a[], and then subtract counts when matching values in b[].
If any required value in b[] is missing or count becomes negative → b[] is not a subset.

pattern used 

Frequency / Hash Map Pattern

Why this pattern works:

The array may contain duplicates.

We must ensure counts also match, not just existence.

Linear search alone can produce wrong results when duplicates are involved.

So counting occurrences with a dictionary ensures accuracy.

  How to Identify Hash Pattern From the Question

When you see this type of line in a problem:

"Check if b[] is a subset of a[]"

You should ask two questions in your mind:

 Does the order matter?

No → subset does not care about order.

Are there duplicates in the arrays?

Yes → the examples show repeated values, such as:

iteration

Step 1: Build Frequency Map of a
Element	Count
11	1
7	2
1	1
13	1
21	1
3	2

Step 2: Check elements in b
b Element	Check in freq?	Available Count?	Action	Updated freq
11	yes 	1 > 0 	freq[11] -= 1	11:0
3	yes 	2 > 0 	freq[3] -= 1	3:1
7	yes 	2 > 0   freq[7] -= 1	7:1
1	yes 	1 > 0 	freq[1] -= 1	1:0
7	yes 	1 > 0 	freq[7] -= 1	7:0

No element failed →  b is subset of a
