DSA PATTERNS (Summary Points)

1. Sliding Window
Use two pointers to create a moving window over array or string.
Efficient for subarray/substring problems.
Keeps track of sum, count, or frequency.

Common uses:
Maximum/minimum sum subarray of size k
Longest substring without repeating characters

2. Two Pointers
Two indices move through the array (either same or opposite direction).
Works best on sorted arrays or linked lists.

Common uses:
Pair/triplet sum problems
Remove duplicates
Reverse arrays or linked lists

3. Prefix Sum / Difference Array
Precompute cumulative sums or differences.
Makes range queries O(1) time.

Common uses:
Range sum queries
Subarray divisible problems
Range update (using difference array)

4. Binary Search
Repeatedly divide search space into halves.
Works on sorted data or monotonic functions.

Common uses:
Searching in sorted array
Finding threshold, boundary, or minimum/maximum satisfying condition
Scheduling or resource allocation problems

5. Sorting + Greedy
Sort the input and make locally optimal (greedy) decisions.

Common uses:
Interval scheduling
Activity selection
Minimizing/maximizing resources
Coin change, job sequencing

6. Linear Search
Sequentially check each element.
Simple and works on unsorted data.

Common uses:
Finding min/max elements
Checking presence of an element
Counting occurrences
