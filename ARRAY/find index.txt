Start from the first element of the array.

Go through the array one element at a time.

For each element:

Check whether the element is equal to x.

If we find arr[i] == x, then:

Return the index i, because we found the element.

If we finish checking the whole array and do not find x:

Return -1 (meaning x is not present inside the array).

approach used is Linear search

Index	Value	Compare with x	Result
0	    10	    10 == 5? 	Continue
1     	8	    8 == 5? 	Continue
2	   30	    30 == 5? 	Continue
3	   4	    4 == 5? 	Continue
4	   5	    5 == 5? 	Return 4
