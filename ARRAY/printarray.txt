problem is to print the arr
first a simple person you think it is easier to do but the diffuclty is when print arr is different output 
for example

input
arr=[10,20,30,40]
output
10,20,30,40

but when you actually used the print approach it print with brackets and commas

to solve we linear approach,Single Pass Iterative Pattern

it peforms opertaing on each element in that array

start to end 

time o(n)
space o(1)

1 beginner

for i in arr:
    print(i, end=" ")

10 20 30 40

2. using *

print(*arr)

10 20 30 40

3.Using join() (String Joining)

print(",".join(map(str, arr)))

10,20,30,40

🔹 Concept:

    map(str, arr) → convert each element to string

    ",".join() → join them with commas

4.Using for loop with indexes

for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i], end=" ")

10 20 30 40

5.using while loop

i = 0
while i < len(arr):
    print(arr[i], end=" ")
    i += 1

10 20 30 40

if want vertical line

print(*arr, sep="\n")

10
20
30
40

if want martix

matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

# Row-wise (horizontal)
for row in matrix:
    print(*row)

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9


Column-wise (vertical)

for i in range(len(matrix[0])):
    for row in matrix:
        print(row[i], end=" ")
    print()

1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9


Pattern: Single Pass Iterative Pattern

This pattern is used because:

You need to perform an operation on every element (printing each).

The task does not require searching, sorting, or skipping elements.

The operation is O(n) — perfect for small, direct operations.


Type	Complexity	Reason
Time	O(n)	You visit each element once
Space	O(1)	No extra memory except loop variable
