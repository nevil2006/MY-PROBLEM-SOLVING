Problem:

Take elements from the array in alternate order, starting from index 0.

Meaning:

Take element at index 0

Skip index 1

Take index 2

Skip index 3

…

Example:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Indexes → Elements
0 → 1 ✔ (take)
1 → 2 ✘ (skip)
2 → 3 ✔ (take)
3 → 4 ✘ (skip)
4 → 5 ✔ (take)

Output → 1 3 5

 4. Logic (In Simple Words)

Here you write your OWN words, very simple:

Start from index 0

Pick one element

Skip next

Pick next

Continue till end

Store picked ones in list

One clear paragraph. No big sentences.

5. Pattern Used

Which pattern is this problem using?

Linear Traversal Pattern

 6. Why This Pattern Works

Explain in one line:

We check every element once from left to right and decide to take it or skip it. That’s why linear traversal works.
