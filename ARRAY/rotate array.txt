input
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
output
[5,1,2,3,4]
Logic (in simple words):

Take the last element of the array and move it to the front.
Shift all other elements one position to the right.

Before: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Take last = 5
Shift right
After: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Pattern Used:

Right Shift Pattern

Why This Pattern Works:

Rotation does not change the order of elements.
It only shifts positions.
So we:

Save the last element

Shift elements to the right

Place the saved element in front

Time Complexity:

O(n) (because we shift n elements)

Space Complexity:
O(1) (no extra array used)
